# Plan for Iteration #3

## High Priority:

- Manage Favorites + Notifications about favorites
- <sub>(Obviously, move to Android App from Text-Based Interface)</sub>

## Minor Improvements of Note

- Add DishLibrary to avoid duplicate creation of dishes across several days
- Add ability to change restrictions w/o clearing all application data
- Considering removing ratings functionality but keeping favorites functionality. This is under consideration depending on project timeline

# Plan for Iteration #2

Based on the below considerations, our plan is to work on getting the menu from the
CBA website, as that is the highest risk component of any of our use cases.

## ~~High priority~~

- ~~Get menu from CBA website in machine\*readable format (high risk, criticality, coverage)~~
- ~~Browse menu (high coverage, high criticality, low risk)~~

## ~~Medium priority~~

- ~~Navigate (high coverage, medium criticality, low risk)~~
- Manage favorites (medium criticality, medium coverage)

## Low priority

- Manage reviews (low criticality, medium coverage)
- Manage personal information (low criticality and coverage)
